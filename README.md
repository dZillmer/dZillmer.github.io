# Introduction

My name is Devon Zillmer, and I am a confident and technically competent ORSA with experience both leading civilians and military personnel and communicating dense technical content in a clear and concise manner. Two years into my teaching assignment in the department of Mathematical Sciences at the United States Military Academy, I am comfortable briefing my work and technical ideas to an audience of all skill levels, and have experience balancing leadership responsibilities with continued research into technical topics.

This is a collection of my work on various recent projects and some of the highlights from my CV. While I am new to collaborating on GitHub, as you can see with some of the files, I've been doing this work offline since graduate school in 2021.

# Example Work

## Bus Demand at CP Humphreys

This project was a request for analytical support by 8th Army Korea ORSAs. The project primarily consisted of data analysis and visualization of two datasets, and a request for quantitative technique to facilitate comparing varying route options in implementing potential new bus routes. The outputs were a variety of visualizations and a basic SimPy simulation that allowed for comparing alternate routes via a "time in transit" metric to compare the existing routes to potential new ones.

## Obesity Research

Conducted with a civilian PhD in the Department of Mathematical Sciences (D/Math) at the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY, in conjunction with several other researchers, to investigate lifestyle factors that could explain the disparity in regional BMI prevalence. Our research question: are there explanatory lifestyle factors that contribute or partially explain the markedly higher obesity rates in the U.S. South and Midwest than the Northeast and West?

## Recent Research

In conjunction with completing a professional development program at USMA called the Master Teacher Program, an officemate and fellow ORSA began a small project that ballooned and ended up culminating in a published article. You can see the original article here: [Improving Student Performance with ILS-Based Student-Teacher Pairings](https://ijonse.net/index.php/ijonse/article/view/133)

The work was largely done in R, but we had a chance to navigate the Human Research Protection (HRPP) process, collect data, clean, merge data sets, and then do the analysis. Abstract and code are posted in the repository here: [ILS Research](https://github.com/dZillmer/ilsResearch)
